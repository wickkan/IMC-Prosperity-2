## Competition Details:

Our goal was to develop a trading strategy that maximised profits in an archipelago's economy using a unique currency called SeaShells.

In this challenge, we developed Python-based trading algorithms to operate within a simulated market environment. The market tested our abilities to both manually and algorithmically trade various products introduced over the course of the competition. Our algorithm, encapsulated within the Trader class, made decisions based on real-time market data provided in the TradingState object each simulation iteration.

Our trading approach was based on interpreting the trading state, which included a detailed snapshot of market activities such as past trades and current buy/sell orders. Decisions to place or adjust orders were made to capitalise on emerging market opportunities, adhere to product position limits, and navigate the complex dynamics of the competitive trading landscape.

While our performance did not top the leaderboard, the challenge provided us with invaluable insights into algorithmic trading, strategy development, and real-time decision-making in a fluctuating market. This experience has deepened our understanding of market dynamics and trading strategies.

Going forward, if we were to participate again, we would aim to refine our algorithms based on the feedback and data gathered from this challenge. Enhancements will focus on better prediction models and more dynamic order management strategies in order to maximise profit.
